## 🧠 6. AI Enhancement Feature in the Portfolio

### **Feature:** ✨ *UI Design*
- **AI Usage:** Codex took my already existing project and changed the design to match the example sites I provided.
- **Implementation:**
    - I provided the link to my repository and some portfolio sites I liked the designs of.
    - AI-generated a version of my code with design elements that match what I was aiming for without strictly copying the examples I provided.
- **Prompt:** Transform the portfolio in this respository to match the following example sites in terms of design without strictly copying any of them. (After this I did not need to include my repository link with other prompts.)
- **Value:** Gives the portfolio a better looking design than what I can come up with on my own.

###
### **Feature:** 🕒 *Smart Greeting Form Assistance*
- **AI Usage:** Codex generated dynamic greeting logic and suggested contextual form helper text.
- **Implementation:**
    - Greeting changes based on local time (`Good morning`, `Good afternoon`, `Good evening`).
    - AI-drafted placeholder/help text for contact form fields (e.g., “Write your message here…”).
- **Prompt:** Implement a smart greeting that changes based on time of day.
- **Value:** Makes the portfolio more interactive and personalized while enhancing user experience.

###
### **Feature:** 📝 *Form Assistance*
- **AI Usage:** Codex generated contextual form helper text and input validation.
- **Implementation:**
    - Form validation to prevent empty inputs and invalid emails.
    - AI generated the logic for the validation and implemented style elements that match the already existing design.
- **Prompt:** Implement a simple front-end only form validation on the already provided form in the contact section.
- **Value:** Also makes the portfolio more interactive while enhancing user experience.

###
### **Feature:** 💡 *Light/Dark Theme Toggles*
- **AI Usage:** Codex generated logic to implement a light/dark theme toggle.
- **Implementation:**
    - Toggle state is stored in local storage to remember the preferred state on refresh.
    - AI helped in providing the logic and refining CSS classes and introducing variables to easily switch between themes.
- **Prompt:** Include a light/dark theme button in the nav bar and implement any necessary logic.
- **Value:** Another way to introduce interactivity to the portfolio and improve UX.

###
### **Feature:** 🧩 *Project Filtering and Sorting*
- **AI Usage:** Codex generated filter and sort buttons that match the portfolio's design with easy to expand logic.
- **Implementation:**
    - Filters are dynamically generated based on categories provided in the project cards and sorting works in three ways based date and title.
    - AI suggested the dynamic filter creation and provided the logic for both filters and sorting and I modified it to match my code.
- **Prompt:** Implement a dynamic way to filter and sort through projects.
- **Value:** Makes the portfolio easier to traverse thus impacting user experience positively.

###
### **Feature:** ✍️ *Debugging issues from integrating Reactbits components*
- **AI Usage:** ChatGPT debugged any issues faced while integrating Reactbits components and helped in component customization.
- **Implementation:**
    - Component code is provided on Reactbits website and I integrated it on my own at first then fixed any reference or styling issues.
    - AI found the parts in my code causing errors and suggested multiple solutions which I then chose from depending on what best matches my code.
- **Prompt:** either a copy of errors messages and relevant code or screenshots of unwanted element layout and what style elements to use or change
- **Value:** Saves time on code debugging.
